## About

This project contains a test against a feed reader application using the jasmine framework. It is mainly to help me practice TDD and gain confidence while working with any application.


## Dependencies
 
 This test requires the jasmine framework to run.
 The app itself uses Google's Feed Reader API to 
 grab RSS feeds as JSON object. It also uses the
 Handlebars templating library and jQuery.


## Getting-Up-And-Running

 the src folder contains my src code and work environment including the tests and the dist folder contains the app ready for use. To get all the tools I used to prepare and test the final app pls check out [build-tools.md](https://github.com/mhizterpaul/feed-reader-testing/blob/master/build-tools.md)
